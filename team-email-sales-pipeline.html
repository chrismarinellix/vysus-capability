Hi everyone,

I'd like to get together to discuss our sales pipeline and business opportunities for grid connection services.

I've put together a capability flyer (attached) that I want to use as a framework for building discussions with clients. This document outlines our key services, track record, and technical capabilities in a format designed for client engagement.

MEETING OBJECTIVE:
- Review current pipeline opportunities
- Discuss how to use this flyer in client conversations
- Training on pre-sales communication techniques
- Identify follow-up actions for active opportunities

IMPORTANT: As engineers, we're generally comfortable talking technical - but closing sales requires a different approach. I want to train you on the communication techniques that help convert technical discussions into commercial opportunities.

Please review the attached flyer before our meeting. I've also attached a pre-sales question guide with four key questions you can use when talking to clients at any stage - whether on existing projects or in new conversations.
